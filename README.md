# Face Detection Video Player

This project demonstrates a video player controlled by face detection using p5.js and ml5.js. The program loads a video from a local file and plays it. The video pauses if no faces are detected through the webcam feed. The program dynamically adjusts the volume and brightness of the video based on face detection.
